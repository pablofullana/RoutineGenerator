RoutineGenerator
===============

Simple form to create a training routine.

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

    $ git clone https://github.com/pablofullana/RoutineGenerator
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake db:migrate
    $ bundle exec rake db:seed
    $ bundle exec rails s
    

Export to PDF File
------------------

Each routine can be visualized (exported/saved if needed) as PDF. You just need to display the routine (show action) and follow the `Open as PDF` link. This will open a new tab in your browser displaying the routine in PDF format.
